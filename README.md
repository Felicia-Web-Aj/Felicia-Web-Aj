# Sentiment Analyzer 🔍💬

This is a simple sentiment analyzer built with Python and TextBlob. 
It allows users to enter a sentence, and the app will return whether the sentiment is 
**positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

## How It Works

1. User runs the app from the terminal or command prompt.
2. The app asks for a sentence.
3. It uses **TextBlob**, a Python library for processing textual data.
4. The sentiment polarity is calculated and classified accordingly.

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **TextBlob** (for sentiment analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for development)
- **Anaconda** (optional environment)
- **Command Prompt** (for running the `.py` file)
